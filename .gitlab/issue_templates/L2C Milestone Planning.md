# work days :calendar: 
Please add a number for days you'll be working this milestone. Team members should subtract a day for each triage day and a day for meetings. Any time-off should also be subtracted from this number. This means that the maximum Days a Data Team member will ever post is 7. If you have two triage days it's 5. **This section should be filled out by the data team members themselves.**
