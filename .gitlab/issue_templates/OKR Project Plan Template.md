## Risk Assessment Plan 

Risks are inherent in every engineering project. A risk is defined as either "the possibility of loss" or as "a potential problem". Every risk has a probability or likeliness to occur as well as a consequence for that risk if it does occur. In order to stay within project constraints, it is important to have a Risk Management plan ready to address any risk or its consequences that may come.  

Below is the plan for Risk Management, which explains how we will identify, analyze, track, report, and resolve risk issues. We will also examine the methods and tools with which we plan to use to track and record the risk, its impact, its status, and its consequences throughout the project lifecycle. 

Being aware of the fact that risks to any project are dynamic, we know that the tracking and managing of risk will be a continuous effort throughout the duration of the project life cycle. As with such, we account for time in our schedule for additional risk and the potential for rework, and we also account into our schedule the small possibility that some risk may not occur while some will.  

We start the Risk Management process by identifying all possible risks that could occur on the project. To do so, we must remember the following places in which risk resides:  
*  Uncertainty – there is inherent risk in project artifacts that we are uncertain of, such as requirements that can be ambiguous or unclear. Similarly, poor communication between stakeholders and poor understanding of deliverables could result in more risk due to uncertainty.  
*  Knowledge – there is inherent risk in what we don't know. Just because we cannot see the risk, does not mean it does not exist. Similarly, the less we know about certain parts of the project presents more risk. For example, if we do not know that we will be doing rework, then this adds more risk to the schedule.   
*  Concerns – "are what we feel uneasy about". Concerns may arise from interpersonal relationship (whether internal, external, or combination), project constraints, schedule changes, or project familiarity (especially with software language).  
*  Issues – requires resolution and increases probability of risk occurring. It may involve people, organizations, or systems.
*  Project/Program Management – these risks are inherent due to the need to manage people or project artifacts as well as any changes decided last minute by any stakeholders on any project artifacts (for example, last minute requirement changes).  
*  Process-Related – these risks are inherent if the process has not been thoroughly and responses have not been documented thoroughly. For example, a poor risk management record or list of poorly constructed requirements. 
*  Product-Related – added complexity in a product introduces additional risk with performance, maintenance, and unclear requirements.  

### Risk Reference Tables  

#### Risk Severity Table 
Risk Severity matrix takes in the inputs of Risk exposure, or the product of the risk probability of occurring and the resulting consequence criterion, against time.

|                   |  Low Risk Exposure  |Medium Risk Exposure |	High Risk Exposure|
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|Short Time	        |  5	              |    2	            |1                    | 
|Medium Time	    | 7	                  | 4	                | 3                   |
|Long Time	        | 9	                  | 8                   |	6                 |

#### Simple Risk Probability Table to Assess Risk Occurence Likelihood 
This table is a simple probability table that can be used to assess risk occurrence likelihood.

| Probability                            | Uncertainty Category           | 
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Less than 40% chance of occurring      |Low                             |
| Between 40% and 70% chance of occurring| Medium                         |
| Greater than 70% chance of occurring.  | High                           |

#### Risk Consequence Table 
Risk Severity matrix takes in the inputs of Risk exposure, or the product of the risk probability of occurring and the resulting consequence criterion, against time.

|   Criterion        |  Cost              |Schedule             |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Low Risk	        |  Less than 1%       |    Slip 1 week      |
| Moderate Risk	    |  Less than 5%       | Slip 2 weeks	    | 
| High Risk	        |  More than 5%	      | Slip more than 2 weeks  |	

#### Time Frame Evaluation Criteria
The table below categorizes the time frame into categories.

| Category | Time Frame |
| ------ | ------ |
| Short | 1 day |
| Medium | 1 week | 
| Long | 1 month | 

#### Risk Prevention  
The team will work to create a plan to reduce as many likelihoods of any project risk from occurring.  We plan to include methods that will assist in risk prevention, risk mitigation, risk resolution, and risk closure. An example of a Prevention Table is seen below for specific risk scenarios.  

|  Risk             |  Severity           |Exposure             | Prevention          |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|Lack of Time	    |  High	              |    High	            |Ensure requirements gathering and planning is as thorough as possible. Budget excess time after final milestone to mitigate the effect of unforeseen delays.                         | 
|Communication	    | Medium	          | Medium	            | Plan weekly status meetings, agree upon communication platform.                        |
| No QA team	    | Low                 | Medium              |	Use Agile; ensure developers are testing their own code                 |



### Roles and Responsibility 

| Role                  | Responsibities                 | 
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Who? What Role?       | Examines risk identity and consequences on all possibly affected systems (both internal and external). Classifies and tracks risk through project lifecycle. |
| Who? What Role?       | Identifies potential risks, its dependencies, and consequences. Estimates risk impact, timing issues, and risk priority. Prioritizes risk. Creates risk mitigation, contingency, and tracking plans.  |
| Who? What Role?       | Communicates to external stakeholders to mitigate risk consequences. Manages communication in risk management.  |
| Who? What Role?       | Assist in the identification and mitigation of risk. Helps analyze the risk environment, impact, consequence, and priority.    |


#### Risk Management Meeting Plan 

*  Risk Management Meeting Schedule - The team will meet every week and discuss any risk that need to be resolved in the future week. We will also meet for emergency situations if necessary by scheduling meetings through email. 

*  Risk Management Retrospective - As a team, we will meet to discuss what we have learned from this project and how we could have mitigated or closed more risks. We will take these lessons onto future projects so that we can be better at risk management.  

### Risk Management Record  
It is important to review all risk via a framework to help business stakeholders understand all the project risk as well as the solution for each risk.
