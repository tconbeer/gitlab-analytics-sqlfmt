### Reviewer Checklist 
* [ ] Review the Submitter Checklist. 
* [ ] Verify Requestors access 

#### Small Data Set
* [ ] Export the file in the requested format using the Snowflake UI's export functionality.

#### Large Data Set
* [ ] Load the dataset in the requested format to the `"RAW"."PUBLIC".SNOWFLAKE_EXPORTS` stage by running:

```
COPY INTO @"RAW"."PUBLIC".SNOWFLAKE_EXPORTS/<identifiable_folder_name>/
FROM (<query>)
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = {CSV | JSON | PARQUET} <other format options>) 
```

Replace the folder name with something unique and recognizable, such as the name of the issue.  Make sure to [add format options](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.html#syntax) to get the data to be formatted as requested.  This is especially important with the CSV format for escaping records and defining delimiters.

By default, the command will create multiple files in GCS.  To just create one file, add the `single = true` option at the end of the command.

After the dataset has been copied into the GCS stage, it can be downloaded from gcs in the [`snowflake_exports` bucket in the `gitlab-analysis` project](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/snowflake_exports).  Download the files and follow the instructions below. 


#### Sharing

<details>
  <summary>For Sensitive Data</summary>
  
* [ ] Encrypt the data into zip file (use `zip -er`)
  - [ ] create a password in 1password and name it the name of the file
  - [ ] If there are multiple files put them in a folder
  - [ ] run `zip -er <zipfilename.zip> <path to file or folder>` and, when prompted, copy and paste the password you created in 1password.
* [ ] Share the file's password with the submitter over a secure channel separate from the channel you will use to send the file.  [One time secret](https://onetimesecret.com/) may be a good option to share passwords, just make sure to not put in any context with the password. 

</details>

* [ ] Share the file with the submitter over a secure channel
* [ ] Reassign this issue to the Submitter for verification of receipt 
* [ ] Once the submitter has verified receipt, delete the file from your computer
