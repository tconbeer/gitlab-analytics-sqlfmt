* [ ]  How long will this data need to reside in the Data team's data warehouse? Expiration Date: ______ 

## Adding/Updating a new sheetload file*
<details><summary>Click on Dropdown for Process</summary>
<br>

* [ ] Step 1: Add CSV/GSheet data to [Sheetload > Sheetload GDrive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F5jKClNEsQstngbrh3UYVzoHAqPTf-l0). Name the file sheetload.file_name (i.e. sheetload.kpi_status)

* [ ] Step 2: Share the file with the required service account - [Email Address to share with](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8kky3DPv2yvH63W4NDYFURrhUwRiMKHI-himxn1r7k/edit?usp=sharing) (GitLab Internal)

* [ ] Step 3: Open up the web ide and let's start the MR! Update extract--> sheetload--> [sheets.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/extract/sheetload/sheets.yml)
    * Add the name of the file_name (i.e. kpi_status)
    * Add yourself as an owner
    * Add the tab name(s) to be imported. Tab names must be unique

* [ ] Step 4: Next in this MR, head to transform --> snowflake-dbt --> models --> sources --> sheetload--> [Edit the sources.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/sources/sheetload/sources.yml). Add the file name as `sheetload_file_name_source`

* [ ] Step 5: In the same repoistory folder as the sources.yml file, you will [add the base model to sources.sheetload repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/sources/sheetload). Naming the file as sheetload_file_name_sources.sql.
        This file will have the following code, but can also be restricted down to specific columns. Update data type of columns in this file (i.e converting value to decimal or varchar)
```sql
        WITH source AS (

        SELECT * 
        FROM {{ source('sheetload','file_name') }}

        )
        SELECT * 
        FROM source
```
* [ ] Step 6: In the sources.sheetload repository [Edit the schema.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/sources/sheetload/schema.yml) to explain the source model. 

* [ ] Step 7: Next we'll head to head to transform --> snowflake-dbt --> models --> staging --> sheetload--> [Add a new file for the model in staging.sheetload](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/tree/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/legacy/sheetload). This will make the model accesible in Sisense. If any transformations are needed, this would be the file to update. Name the file `sheetload_file_name`

* [ ] Step 8: [Update staging.sheetload schema.yml file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/legacy/sheetload/schema.yml) to add description of the staging model. 

To understand the difference between source and staging models, please refer to these sources: [source models](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/dbt-guide/#source-models) vs [staging models](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/dbt-guide/#staging)

#### Testing

<details>
<summary><i>Click to toggle Testing</i></summary>

* [ ] Every model should be [tested](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing-and-documentation) AND documented in a `schema.yml` file. At minimum, unique, not nullable fields, and foreign key constraints should be tested, if applicable.
* [ ] All models should be integrated into the [trusted data framework](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/#tdf)
  * [ ] If there is an associated MR in the [Data Tests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/data-tests) project, be sure to pass the branch name to the manual job using the `DATA_TEST_BRANCH` environment variable.
* [ ] If the periscope_query job failed, validate that the changes you've made don't affect the grain of the table or the expected output in Periscope.
* [ ] If you are on the Data Team, please paste the output of `dbt test` when run locally below. Any failing tests should be fixed or explained prior to requesting a review.

## CI Jobs to run*
Run the following CI Jobs on the MR: 

* [ ] `❄️ Snowflake: clone_raw_sheetload`
* [ ] `Extract: sheetload`
* [ ] `⚙️ dbt Run: specify_raw_model`
    * Pass `DBT_MODELS` as key and `sources.sheetload` for value (alternatively, you can pass `sources.sheetload_file_name_source`)
* [ ] In the case there is staging model, run `⚙️ dbt Run: specify_model`
    * Pass `DBT_MODELS` as key and `staging.sheetload` for value (alternatively, you can pass `staging.sheetload_file_name`)

## Final Steps
* [ ]  Assign MR to project maintainer for review (iterate until model is complete).
* [ ]  Data Team project maintainers/owners to merge in dbt models 
* [ ]  If not urgent, data will be availble within 24 hours. If urgent, Data Engineer to run full refresh and inform when available.
* [ ]  Submitter to query in Sisense for table: ``` SELECT * FROM [new-dbt-model-name] LIMIT 10 ```.
